# Installing
Step 1: Start the XAMPP program. When started, XAMPP loads itself into your icon tray. The icon is orange with a white bone-like shape in its center.
Step 2: Place your PHP files in the "HTDocs" folder located under the "XAMMP" folder on your C: drive. The file path is "C:\xampp\htdocs" for your Web server. Make sure your PHP files are saved as such; they must have the ".php" file extension. 
Step 3: Create any folders you need to test PHP files in under the "HTDocs" folder. If you create a folder named "scripts," then use the address "localhost/scripts" to open them in your browser.
